BEHAVIOR:
  name: humanoid::active_walk
  traj_com_duration: 5 # duration of trajectories moving the com
  traj_foot_duration: 5 # duration of trajectories moving a foot
  traj_stop_duration: 5 # stop duration after putting com in the middle of the convex hull, only works with go_to_middle to true
  remove_contacts: true # remove/add contacts you can put false if you just want the robot to put move the com without moving the feet
  step_height: 0.1 # height of the step
  step_length: 0.1 # lenght of the step
  step_lateral: 0.00 # lateral lenght of the step
  com_percentage: 0.4 # put the com reference inside the foot (at com_percentage*(external_foot_border - internal_foot_border) + internal_foot_border)
  force_treshold: 50000 # when putting foot on ground if the FT sensor returns more than force_treshold, the foot will not be lowered any furhter
  go_to_middle: true # put this to true for the com to stop in the middle of the convex hull (when going from one foot to the other)
  num_cycles: 10 # put -1 for infinite
  send_vel_acc: true # if true it will give vel and acc references to the tasks
  one_foot: false # do not walk but put the robot on one foot
  customize_task_weights:
    momentum: 0.0
